            <h3>East Austin Succulents Blossoms with BigCommerce</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Beginning in 2009, EAS has since thrived as a solely brick-and-mortar nursery, but in 2020, the team decided it was time to go digital.

                “We existed everywhere but the internet, and we had a pretty well-established reputation in central Texas,” said EAS’s customer service manager and assistant web shop manager, Rachel Harris. “But nobody else really knew about us, and we thought it was time to change that.”
                
                To help expand the nursery’s reach, the team built the East Austin Succulents webshop — which now serves plant lovers not only in Central Texas, but also across all 50 states.
                
                However, with the webshop launching during the peak of the pandemic, EAS not only had to navigate how to sell online for the first time, but they had also recently closed their retail nursery and transitioned to appointment only.
                
                “We were having to navigate how to allow for orders to be fulfilled in-person through our web shop, but also how to ship them out. We were learning a lot all at once, but it was a huge win because we’re still here,” said Harris.</p>
